==============================
To run the program, run java topsecret.
    No arguments: if run with no arguments, the program prints out a numbered
        list of files from the data folder.
    One argument: if run with a number argument, the program prints out the
        contents of the file corresponding to the provided number. If the file
        is encrypted, a default cipher will be used to decrypt it. If the
        number does not have an associated file, or the first argument is not a
        number, the program will print an error message.
    Two arguments: if run with a number and a key, the program will print out
        the contents of the file, and use the provided key to decrypt it. If
        the provided key is invalid, the program will print an error message.
    3+ arguments: if three or more arguments are given, the program will print
        an error message
