Goal:

Given a request for a file in the data folder -> return the contents of that file

Implementation/UML:

FileHandler
-------------------
-content: String
-------------------
+handle()
+getContent()
+setContent()

- Cases
  Handle Class
  1. Request for a file that works and is found within data
  2. Request for a file that exists within project but is not within data
  3. Request for a file that does not exist
  4. Request for a file that doesn't contain text (Audio File, PNG, ... etc.)

- Testing
  Handle Class
  Case 1. Should return the full contents of that file
  Case 2. Should gracefully fail and ask for a proper file within data by returning an error string
  Case 3. Should gracefully fail and ask for a proper file within data by returning an error string
  Case 4. Should gracefully fail and ask for a proper file within data by returning an error string
