Goal:

Given a request for a file in the data folder -> return the contents of that file

Implementation:

- Method which is given an input which is the file being requested -> method will return a string with the contents
  - filehandler(String filename) -> String filecontents

- Cases
  1. Request for a file that works and is found within data
  2. Request for a file that exists within project but is not within data
  3. Request for a file that does not exist
  4. Request for a file that doesn't contain text (Audio File, PNG, ... etc.)

- Testing
  Case 1. Should return the full contents of that file
  Case 2. Should gracefully fail and ask for a proper file within data by returning an error string
  Case 3. Should gracefully fail and ask for a proper file within data by returning an error string
  Case 4. Should gracefully fail and ask for a proper file within data by returning an error string
